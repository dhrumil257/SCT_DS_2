# SCT_DS_2
# Introduction

This reposiotry contains the code and analysis for Task 2 of my Data Science internship at SkillCraft Technology. For this task, I performed data cleaning and explanatory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of my choice. I chose the Titanic dataset from the provided link from kaggle.

# Dataset
The [Titanic dataset(https://github.com/dhrumil257/SCT_DS_2/blob/main/train.csv)] is a well-known dataset in the field of data science and contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographics and survival status. This dataset is widely used for educational purposes and provides an opportunity to explore various data analysis techniques.
